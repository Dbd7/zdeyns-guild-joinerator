# zdeyns-guild-joinerator 0.1.0
Allows easy auto-join of Hardcore guilds using 'join x', 'join y', and 'join z' buttons (configurable!)
Easily integrates with players who aren't using it! 
 - Others invite you to the guild after receiving a plain whisper from you, and 
 - You invite others via a pop-up in response to being whispered `"ginv"`

Any problems, PLEASE:

Thanks in advance for your early feedback!
